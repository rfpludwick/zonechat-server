# ZoneChat Server

This is the server for the ZoneChat application, written in Go. This project
originated from my desire to practice Go a little bit while learning websockets.
I settled upon duplicating the
[chat example](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/tree/master/examples/chat)
in the [Gorilla websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) implementation
for Go. I ended up expanding upon it and decided to make a little bit more of a
fully-featured chat application.
